## Our Pledge

We, the members, contributors, and leaders, unite in our commitment to foster an inclusive and welcoming community. Our aim is to ensure that every individual can participate without experiencing harassment or discrimination, irrespective of their age, physical attributes, disabilities, ethnicity, gender identity, experience level, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, sexual identity, or orientation.

Our mission is to cultivate a community that is diverse, open, and healthy.

## Our Expectations

We believe in creating a positive community environment by:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness in all interactions.
- Respecting diverse opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.
- Offering and receiving constructive feedback gracefully.
- Taking ownership of our actions, apologizing when necessary, and learning from our experiences.
- Focusing on the betterment of the community as a whole, not just individual interests.

## Unacceptable Behavior

We define unacceptable behavior as:

- The use of sexualized language, imagery, or making unwelcome advances.
- Engaging in trolling, insults, derogatory comments, or personal or political attacks.
- Harassment, whether public or private.
- Sharing private information, such as physical or email addresses, without explicit consent.
- Conduct that would be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Enforcement and Responsibility

Our community leaders are entrusted with the responsibility of upholding and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior. They will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the authority to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct. They will also communicate the reasons for moderation decisions as needed.

## Scope of Application

This Code of Conduct applies to all community spaces. It also extends to situations where an individual officially represents the community in public contexts, such as using an official email address, posting from an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement Procedures

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior should be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at [vatsalsinghkv@gmail.com][admin]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.
